# PyPoll Analysis
## Project Overview
### Background
We've been brought on to assist Seth and Tom submit the audit results to the election commission. The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit.
- The voter turnout for each county.
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
- The county with the highest turnout.
### Purpose
The goal of this code is to read data from a .csv file and use for loops and conditionals to write a .txt file containing the results of the election. 
## The Audit
- 369,711 total votes were cast.
- Breakdown of each county in the precinct.

## Summary
The Code provided could be used to gather the number of votes on specific candidates, the number of votes coming from different, and pick out the one that has the most votes. The code could and should be modified to be able to gather the info on different formatting on the .csv files. So instead of using specific columns of data, get it from the name of the columns.
